II LL LL DD…

II = intended target:
00 = server
01 = app
02 = band
03-FF = reserved

LL = length, max 64k. set high bit to say it’s more than 64k

—

* app initiates a mate
* server controls the entire mating process
* app passes packets until it receives a mated packet from both server and band
- app can peek at packet to see if it's an error or not... if error, needs to decrypt and display error, and mating process stops
